##### JavaScript is a programming language that adds interactivity to your website.

__Variables__

Variables are containers that you can store values in.

declaring a variable

```javascript
var myVariable;
```
assigning a value to variable
```javascript
myVariable = "crash";
```

declaring a variable with value

```javascript
var myVariable = "crash";
```
**Note**: JavaScript is case sensitive â€” myVariable is a different variable to myvariable. If you are getting problems in your code, check the casing!


**Data Types**

* String
* Number
* Boolean
* Array
* Object

**Comments**

```javascript
/*
Everything in between is a comment.
*/
```
```javascript
// This is a comment too
```
